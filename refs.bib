  abstract = {The application of White Rabbit precision time protocol (WR-PTP) in long-distance optical fiber links has been investigated. WR-PTP is an implementation of PTP in synchronous Ethernet optical fiber networks, originally intended for synchronization of equipment within a range of 10 km. This paper discusses the results and limitations of two implementations of WR-PTP in the existing communication fiber networks. A 950-km WR-PTP link was realized using unidirectional paths in a fiber pair between Espoo and Kajaani, Finland. The time transfer on this link was compared (after initial calibration) against a clock comparison by GPS precise point positioning (PPP). The agreement between the two methods remained within ±2 ns over three months of measurements. Another WR-PTP implementation was realized between Delft and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, by cascading two links of 137 km each. In this case, the WR links were realized as bidirectional paths in single fibers. The measured time offset between the starting and end points of the link was within 5 ns with an uncertainty of 8 ns, mainly due to the estimated delay asymmetry caused by chromatic dispersion.},

  abstract = {We perform experiments exploring the use of white rabbit precision time protocol (WR-PTP) for time and frequency dissemination over long-distance optical fiber links. We use unidirectional links, to ensure compatibility with active telecommunication networks, and White Rabbit equipment with modifications for improved performance. Using fiber spools, we realize a 500 km, four-span cascaded white rabbit link. We show short term fractional frequency stability of 2 ×10−12, averaging down to 2 ×10−15 at one day of integration time, with no frequency shift within the statistical uncertainty. We demonstrate the impact of increasing the White Rabbit SoftPLL bandwidth and the PTP message rate. We show evidence of the effect of thermal fluctuations acting on the fiber, and finally discuss the limitations of the achieved performance. We show comparisons with experimental data acquired with commercial good quality global positioning system (GPS) receivers and show that the medium- and long- term stability and accuracy are more than one order of magnitude better with a WR-PTP link.},

  abstract = {Quantum communications promises reliable transmission of quantum information, efficient distribution of entanglement and generation of completely secure keys. For all these tasks, we need to determine the optimal point-to-point rates that are achievable by two remote parties at the ends of a quantum channel, without restrictions on their local operations and classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. These two-way assisted capacities represent the ultimate rates that are reachable without quantum repeaters. Here, by constructing an upper bound based on the relative entropy of entanglement and devising a dimension-independent technique dubbed ‘teleportation stretching’, we establish these capacities for many fundamental channels, namely bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we exactly determine the fundamental rate-loss tradeoff affecting any protocol of quantum key distribution. Our findings set the limits of point-to-point quantum communications and provide precise and general benchmarks for quantum repeaters.},

  abstract = {The development of prototype metropolitan-scale quantum networks is underway and entails transmitting quantum information via single photons through deployed optical fibers spanning several tens of kilometers. The major challenges in building metropolitan-scale quantum networks are compensation of polarization mode dispersion, high-precision clock synchronization, and compensation for cumulative transmission time fluctuations. One approach addressing these challenges is to co-propagate classical probe signals in the same fiber as the quantum signal. Thus, both signals experience the same conditions, and the changes of the fiber can therefore be monitored and compensated. Here, we demonstrate the distribution of polarization entangled quantum signals co-propagating with the White Rabbit Precision Time Protocol (WR-PTP) classical signals in the same single-core fiber strand at metropolitan-scale distances. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this quantum-classical coexistence by achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution between nodes separated by 100 km of optical fiber. This advancement is a significant step towards the practical implementation of robust and efficient metropolitan-scale quantum networks.},
